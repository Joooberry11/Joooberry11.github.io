… Nangangamba nangangamba ang 'yong puso
Hindi ka sigurado ('di ka sigurado)
Nalilito nalilito ang 'yong utak
Kung tunay bang pag ibig 'to (tunay bang pag ibig 'to)
… Ano ba ang problema mo
Sabihin na ang totoo
… Sabihin mo na nilalaman ng puso mo
At nararamdaman nito
Kung 'di pa aminin ang gusto
Baka kasi mawala na ako
… Nagulat ka nagulat ka no'ng
May kasama na 'kong iba (kasama na 'kong iba)
Pakipot ka 'wag nang pakipot pa
Baka maagaw pa ng iba (maagaw pa ng iba)
… Wala nang magbabago
Kung 'di mo pa aminin 'to
… Sabihin mo na nilalaman ng puso mo
At nararamdaman nito
Kung 'di pa aminin ang gusto
Baka kasi mawala na ako
… Ito na ang pagkakataon
Wala nang pipigil sa 'yo
'Wag ka nang mahihiya
Sabihin na ang totoo
… Sabihin mo na nilalaman ng puso mo
At nararamdaman nito
Kung 'di pa aminin ang gusto oh
… Sabihin mo na nilalaman ng puso mo
At nararamdaman nito
Kung 'di pa aminin ang gusto
Baka kasi mawala na ako

***YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, KID***

Summer went away
Still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets
Take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

***YOUR POWER***

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange
She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back, would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange
I thought that I was special, you made me feel
Like it was my fault you were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain
Mmm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hmm
